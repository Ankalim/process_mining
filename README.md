* [Process Mining: A DATABASE OF APPLICATIONS](https://www.win.tue.nl/ieeetfpm/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=news:process_mining_database_applications_2018b.pdf)

The reason for carrying out this research is to create the most complete list of all the adoptions of process mining techniques and
to collect, directly from who has been involved, basic information about the utilization of this methodology.
The purpose of the study is to create a database of practical cases, no matter the specific industries and the final results, with the
only aim of completeness and validity.
The intended audience includes all those researchers, data scientists, managers and firms that are willing to implement process
mining solutions or simply explore business potentials of process mining in improving business processes or in developing new
performance management practices based on real data, extracted from IT systems.
Therefore, the final goal of this knowledge endeavour still remains the same of the first edition, which is to contribute to build
awareness and confidence about process mining methods

**Abstract** 

Process discovery algorithms discover process models on the basis of
event data automatically. These techniques tend to consider the entire log to discover a process model. However, real-life event logs usually contain outlier behaviour that lead to incomprehensible, complex and inaccurate process models
where correct and/or important behaviour is undetectable. Hence, removing outlier behaviour thanks to filtering techniques is an essential step to retrieve a good
quality process model. Manually filtering the event log is tricky and requires a
significant amount of time. On the other hand, some work in the past is focused
on providing a fully automatic choice of the parameters of the discovery and filtering algorithms; however, the attempts were not completely successful. This
demo paper describes an easy-to-use plug-in in the ProM process mining framework, that provides a view where several process discovery and outlier filtering
algorithms can be chosen, along with their parameters, in order to find a sweet
spot leading to a ’good’ process model. The filtered log is easily accessible, and
the process model is shown inside the view, in this way the user can immediately
evaluate the quality of the chosen combination between process discovery and
filtering algorithms, and is effectively assisted in the choice of the preprocessing
methodology. Some commonly used metrics (fitness, precision) are reported in
the view provided by the plug-in, in order to ease the evaluation of the process
model. With the options provided by our plug-in, the difficulties of both fullymanual and automatic choice of the filtering approach are effectively overcome.
